Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Task Management Web Application
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a Task Management Web Application that helps users organize their daily tasks efficiently. Each user can register, log in, and manage their own list of tasks securely.

1.2 Scope

The system will allow users to:

Sign up and log in securely using Supabase Authentication.

Add, view, update, mark as complete, and delete their personal tasks.

Set a priority level and due date for each task.

View tasks filtered by completion status or priority.

Edit basic user profile details (like display name).

The application will be built using Next.js (App Router) and Supabase, styled with Tailwind CSS or Shadcn UI, and deployed on Vercel.

2. System Overview
2.1 Technologies Used

Frontend: Next.js 15+ (TypeScript)

Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Authentication: Supabase Auth (Email/Password)

UI Framework: Tailwind CSS / Shadcn UI

Form Handling: React Hook Form

Hosting: Vercel
